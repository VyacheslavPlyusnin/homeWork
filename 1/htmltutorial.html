  <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
  
  <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (<u>HTML</u>)</b> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.</p>
  
  <p>Web browsers receive <u>HTML</u> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <u>HTML</u> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
  
  <p><u>HTML</u> elements are the building blocks of <u>HTML</u> pages. With <u>HTML</u> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <u>HTML</u> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <u>HTML</u> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <span class="teg">&lt;img&gt;</span> and <span class="teg">&lt;input&gt;</span> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <span class="teg">&lt;p&gt;</span> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the <u>HTML</u> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

  <h2>Markup</h2>
  
  <p><u>HTML</u> markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. <u>HTML</u> tags most commonly come in pairs like <span class="teg">&lt;h1&gt;</span> and <span class="teg">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <span class="teg">&lt;img&gt;</span>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
  </p>
  <p>Another important component is the <u>HTML</u> document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.
  </p>
  
  <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
  </p> 
  <pre >
      <span class="teg">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
      <span class="teg">&lt;html&gt;</span>
          <span class="teg">&lt;head&gt;</span>
              <span class="teg">&lt;title&gt;</span>This is a title <span class="teg">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
          <span class="teg">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
          <span class="teg">&lt;body&gt;</span>
              <span class="teg">&lt;p&gt;</span>Hello world!<span class="teg">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
          <span class="teg">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
      <span class="teg">&lt;/html&gt;</span> </pre>
